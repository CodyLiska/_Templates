## 📁 Project Structure

```
src/
  components/         # Reusable UI components (NavBar, Footer, Cards, etc.)
  pages/              # Route views (LandingPage, Team, Players, etc.)

```

## 🛠 Adding to the App

### ➕ Adding a Page

1. Create a new `.vue` file in the `src/pages/` folder:

```bash
src/pages/About.vue
```

2. Add basic content:

```vue
<template>
  <h2>About Page</h2>
</template>
```

3. Register the route in `src/router/index.js`:

````js
import About from '../pages/About.vue'

const routes = [
  { path: '/about', component: About },
]\```

### 🧩 Adding a Component
1. Create a new component in `src/components/`:
```bash
src/components/MyCard.vue
````

2. Import it and use in a page or another component:

```vue
<script setup>
import MyCard from '../components/MyCard.vue'
</script>
```

### 🧭 Updating Navigation

To link new pages, edit `NavBar.vue`:

```vue
<RouterLink to="/about">About</RouterLink>
```

## 🧪 Testing the App

Currently, no testing framework is included. Suggestions:

- **Unit Testing:** [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) + [Vue Test Utils](https://test-utils.vuejs.org/)
- **E2E Testing:** [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/)

### Add Vitest

```bash
npm install -D vitest vue-test-utils
```

Example test setup can be added later as needed.

## 🧱 Building it Out

To expand this into a production-ready app:

### Suggested Enhancements

- ✅ Authentication (e.g. Coaches/Parents login)
- ✅ Global State Management with [Pinia](https://pinia.vuejs.org/)
- ✅ API integration with [Axios](https://axios-http.com/)
- ✅ Form validation with [Vuelidate](https://vuelidate.js.org/) or [vee-validate](https://vee-validate.logaretm.com/)
- ✅ Use a CSS framework like Bootstrap or Bulma (already discussed)
- ✅ Add transitions and animations
- ✅ Add responsive and accessibility improvements

### Folder Suggestions

You can organize your code further:

```
src/
  assets/             # Images, icons, styles
  store/              # Global state (Pinia)
  composables/        # Reusable logic (like useUsers.js)
```
